<p class="break">I must begin what I have to say with a
warning and an apology. I must warn you
that the present essay makes no pretence to
be an adequate treatment of some compact
and limited theme; but rather resembles those
wandering trains of thought, where we allow
ourselves the luxury of putting wide-ranging
questions, to which our ignorance forbids any
confident reply. I apologise for adopting a
course which thus departs in some measure
from familiar precedent. I admit its perils.
But it is just possible that when a subject, or
group of subjects, is of great inherent interest,
even a tentative, and interrogative, treatment
of it may be worth attempting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>My subject, or at least my point of departure,
is Decadence. I do not mean the
sort of decadence often attributed to certain
phases of artistic or literary development, in
which an overwrought technique, straining to
express sentiments too subtle or too morbid,
is deemed to have supplanted the direct inspiration
of an earlier and a simpler age.
Whether these autumnal glories, these splendours
touched with death, are recurring phenomena
in the literary cycle: whether, if they
be, they are connected with other forms
of decadence, may be questions well worth
asking and answering. But they are not the
questions with which I am at present concerned.
The decadence respecting which I wish to
put questions is not literary or artistic, it is
political and national. It is the decadence
which attacks, or is alleged to attack, great
communities and historic civilisations: which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
is to societies of men what senility is to man,
and is often, like senility, the precursor and
the cause of final dissolution.</p>

<p>It is curious how deeply imbedded in
ordinary discourse are traces of the conviction
that childhood, maturity, and old age,
are stages in the corporate, as they are in
the individual, life. “A young and vigorous
nation,” “a decrepit and moribund civilisation”—phrases
like these, and scores of others
containing the same implication, come as trippingly
from the tongue as if they suggested
no difficulty and called for no explanation.
To Macaulay (unless I am pressing his famous
metaphor too far) it seemed natural that ages
hence a young country like New Zealand should
be flourishing, but not less natural that an old
country like England should have decayed.
Berkeley, in a well-known stanza, tells how the
drama of civilisation has slowly travelled westwards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
to find its loftiest development, but also
its final catastrophe, in the New World. While
every man who is weary, hopeless, or disillusioned
talks as if he had caught these
various diseases from the decadent epoch in
which he was born.</p>

<p>But why <em>should</em> civilisations thus wear out
and great communities decay? and what evidence
is there that in fact they do? These
questions, though I cannot give to them any
conclusive answers, are of much more than
a merely theoretic interest. For if current
modes of speech take decadence more or less
for granted, with still greater confidence do
they speak of Progress as assured. Yet if
both are real they can hardly be studied apart,
they must evidently limit and qualify each
other in actual experience, and they cannot
be isolated in speculation.</p>

<p>Though antiquity, Pagan and Christian,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
took a different view, it seems easier, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i>,
to understand Progress than Decadence. Even
if the former be limited, as presumably it is,
by the limitation of human faculty, we should
expect the ultimate boundary to be capable
of indefinite approach, and we should <em>not</em>
expect that any part of the road towards it,
once traversed, would have to be retraced.
Even in the organic world, decay and death,
familiar though they be, are phenomena that
call for scientific explanation. And Weismann
has definitely asked how it comes about that
the higher organisms grow old and die, seeing
that old age and death are not inseparable
characteristics of living protoplasm, and that
the simplest organisms suffer no natural decay,
perishing, when they do perish, by accident,
starvation, or specific disease.</p>

<p>The answer he gives to his own question is
that the death of the individual is so useful to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
the race, that Natural Selection has, in all but
the very lowest species, exterminated the potentially
immortal.</p>

<p>One is tempted to enquire, whether this ingenious
explanation could be so modified as to
apply not merely to individuals but to communities.
Is it needful for the cause of civilisation
as a whole, that the organised embodiment of
each particular civilisation, if and when its free
development is arrested, should make room for
younger and more vigorous competitors? And
if so can we find in Natural Selection the
mechanism by which the principle of decay
and dissolution shall be so implanted in the
very nature of human associations that a due
succession among them shall always be maintained?</p>

<p>To this second question the answer must,
I think, be in the negative. The struggle for
existence between different races and different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
societies has admittedly played a great part in
social development. But to extend Weismann’s
idea from the organic to the social world, would
imply a prolonged competition between groups
of communities in which decadence was the rule,
and groups in which it was not;—ending in the
survival of the first, and the destruction of the
second. The groups whose members suffered
periodical decadence and dissolution would be
the fittest to survive: just as, on Weismann’s
theory, those species gain in competitive efficiency
whom death has unburdened of the old.</p>

<p>Few will say that in the petty fragment of
human history which alone is open to our inspection,
there is satisfactory evidence of any
such long drawn process. Some may even be
disposed to ask whether there is adequate
evidence of such a phenomenon as decadence
at all. And it must be acknowledged that the
affirmative answer should be given with caution.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
Evidently we must not consider a diminution of
national power, whether relative or absolute,
as constituting by itself a proof of national
decadence. Holland is not decadent because
her place in the hierarchy of European Powers
is less exalted than it was two hundred and fifty
years ago. Spain was not necessarily decadent
at the end of the seventeenth century because
she had exhausted herself in a contest far beyond
her resources either in money or in men. It
would, I think, be rash even to say that Venice
was decadent at the end of the eighteenth
century, though the growth of other Powers,
and the diversion of the great trade routes, had
shorn her of wealth and international influence.
These are misfortunes which in the sphere of
sociology correspond to accident or disease in
the sphere of biology. And what we are concerned
to know is whether in the sphere of
sociology there is also anything corresponding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
to the decay of old age—a decay which may be
hastened by accident or disease, which must be
ended by accident or disease, but is certainly to
be distinguished from both.</p>

<p>However this question should be answered
the cases I have cited are sufficient to shew
where the chief difficulty of the enquiry lies.
Decadence, even if it be a reality, never acts
in isolation. It is always complicated with, and
often acts through, other more obvious causes.
It is always therefore possible to argue that
to these causes, and not to the more subtle
and elusive influences collectively described as
’decadence,’ the decline and fall of great
communities is really due.</p>

<p>Yet there are historic tragedies which (as
it seems to me) do most obstinately refuse
to be thus simply explained. It is in vain
that historians enumerate the public calamities
which preceded, and no doubt contributed to,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
the final catastrophe. Civil dissensions, military
disasters, pestilences, famines, tyrants, tax-gatherers,
growing burdens, and waning wealth—the
gloomy catalogue is unrolled before our
eyes, yet somehow it does not in all cases wholly
satisfy us: we feel that some of these diseases
are of a kind which a vigorous body politic
should easily be able to survive, that others are
secondary symptoms of some obscurer malady,
and that in neither case do they supply us with
the full explanations of which we are in search.</p>

<p>Consider for instance the long agony and
final destruction of Roman Imperialism in the
West, the most momentous catastrophe of which
we have historic record. It has deeply stirred the
imagination of mankind, it has been the theme
of great historians, it has been much explained
by political philosophers, yet who feels that
either historians or philosophers have laid bare
the inner workings of the drama? Rome fell,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
and great was the fall of it. But why it fell, by
what secret mines its defences were breached,
and what made its garrison so faint-hearted and
ineffectual—this is not so clear.</p>

<p>In order to measure adequately the difficulty
of the problem let us abstract our minds from
historical details and compare the position of the
Empire about the middle of the second century,
with its position in the middle of the third, or
again at the end of the fourth, and ask of what
forces history gives us an account, sufficient in
these periods to effect so mighty a transformation.
Or, still better, imagine an observer
equipped with our current stock of political
wisdom, transported to Rome in the reign of
Antoninus Pius or Marcus Aurelius, and in
ignorance of the event, writing letters to the
newspapers on the future destinies of the Empire.
What would his forecast be?</p>

<p>We might suppose him to examine, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
first place, the military position of the State, its
probable enemies, its capacities for defence. He
would note that only on its eastern boundary
was there an organised military Power capable
of meeting Rome on anything like equal terms,
and this only in the regions adjacent to their
common frontier. For the rest he would discover
no civilised enemy along the southern
boundary to the Atlantic or along its northern
boundary from the Black Sea to the German
Ocean. Warlike tribes indeed he would find
in plenty: difficult to crush within the limits of
their native forests and morasses, formidable it
may be in a raid, but without political cohesion,
military unity, or the means of military concentration;—embarrassing
therefore rather than
dangerous. If reminded of Varus and his lost
legions, he would ask of what importance, in
the story of a world-power could be the loss
of a few thousand men surprised at a distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
from their base amid the entanglements of
a difficult and unknown country. Never, it
would seem, was Empire more fortunately circumstanced
for purposes of home defence.</p>

<p>But (it might be thought) the burden of
securing frontiers of such length, even against
merely tribal assaults, though easy from a
strictly military point of view, might prove
too heavy to be long endured. Yet the
military forces scattered through the Roman
Empire, though apparently adequate in the
days of her greatness would, according to
modern ideas, seem hardly sufficient for purposes
of police, let alone defence. An army
corps or less was deemed enough to preserve
what are now mighty kingdoms, from internal
disorder and external aggression. And if we
compare with this the contributions, either in
the way of money or of men, exacted from the
territories subject to Rome before the Empire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
came into being, or at any period of the world’s
history since it dissolved away, the comparison
must surely be entirely in favour of the Empire.</p>

<p>But burdens which seem light, if measured
by area, may be heavy if measured by ability
to pay. Yet when has ability to pay been
greater in the regions bordering the Southern
and Eastern Mediterranean than under the
Roman Empire? Travel round it in imagination,
eastward from the Atlantic coast of
Morocco till returning westward you reach the
head of the Adriatic Gulf, and you will have
skirted a region, still of immense natural
wealth, once filled with great cities, and fertile
farms, better governed during the Empire than
it has ever been governed since (at least till
Algeria became French and Egypt British);
including among its provinces what were great
states before the Roman rule, and have been
great states since that rule decayed, divided by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
no international jealousies, oppressed by no fear
of conquest, enterprising, cultured. Remember
that to estimate its area of taxation and recruiting
you must add to these regions Bulgaria,
Servia, much of Austria and Bavaria, Switzerland,
Belgium, Italy, France, Spain, and most
of Britain, and you have conditions favourable
to military strength and economic prosperity
rarely equalled in the modern world and never
in the ancient.</p>

<p>Our observer however might, very rightly,
feel that a far-spreading Empire like that of
Rome, including regions profoundly differing
in race, history and religion, would be liable to
other dangers than those which arise from mere
external aggression. One of the first questions,
therefore, which he would be disposed to ask,
is whether so heterogeneous a state was not
in perpetual danger of dissolution through the
disintegrating influence of national sentiments.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
He would learn probably, with a strong feeling
of surprise, that with the single exception of
the Jews, the constituent nations, once conquered,
were not merely content to belong to
the Empire, but could scarcely imagine themselves
doing anything else: that the Imperial
system appealed, not merely to the material
needs of the component populations, but also to
their imagination and their loyalty; that Gaul,
Spain, and Britain, though but recently forced
within the pale of civilisation, were as faithful
to the Imperial ideal as the Greek of Athens or
the Hellenised Orientals of Syria; and that
neither historic memories, nor local patriotism,
neither disputed succession, nor public calamities,
nor administrative divisions, ever really
shook the sentiment in favour of Imperial Unity.
There might be more than one Emperor: but
there could only be one Empire. Howsoever
our observer might disapprove of the Imperial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
system he would therefore have to admit that
the Empire, with all its shortcomings, its absolutism
and its bureaucracy, had solved more
successfully than any government, before or
since, the problem of devising a scheme which
equally satisfied the sentiments of East and
West; which respected local feelings, encouraged
local government; in which the Celt,
the Iberian, the Berber, the Egyptian, the
Asiatic, the Greek, the Illyrian, the Italian
were all at home, and which, though based on
conquest, was accepted by the conquered as
the natural organisation of the civilised world.</p>

<p>Rome had thus unique sources of strength.
What sources of weakness would our observer
be likely to detect behind her imposing exterior?
The diminution of population is the
one which has (rightly I think) most impressed
historians: and it is difficult to resist the
evidence, either of the fact, or of its disastrous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
consequences. I hesitate indeed to accept
without qualification the accounts given us of
the progressive decay of the native Italian
stock from the days of the Gracchi to the disintegration
of the Empire in the West: and
when we read how the dearth of men was
made good (in so far as it was made good) by
the increasing inflow of slaves and adventurers
from every corner of the known world, one
wonders <em>whose</em> sons they were who, for three
centuries and more, so brilliantly led the van
of modern European culture, as it emerged
from the darkness of the early Middle Ages.
Passing by such collateral issues, however,
and admitting depopulation to have been
both real and serious, we may well ask
whether it was not the result of Roman decadence
rather than its cause, the symptom
of some deep-seated social malady, not its
origin. We are not concerned here with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
the aristocracy of Rome, nor even with the
people of Italy. We are concerned with
the Empire. We are not concerned with a
passing phase or fashion, but with a process
which seems to have gone on with increasing
rapidity, through good times as well as bad,
till the final cataclysm. A local disease might
have a local explanation, a transient one might
be due to a chance coincidence. But what can
we say of a disease which was apparently co-extensive
with Imperial civilisation in area,
and which exceeded it in duration?</p>

<p>I find it hard to believe that either a selfish
aversion to matrimony or a mystical admiration
for celibacy, though at certain periods the one
was common in Pagan and the other in Christian
circles, were more than elements in the
complex of causes by which the result was
brought about. Like the plagues which devastated
Europe in the second and third<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
centuries, they must have greatly aggravated
the evil, but they are hardly sufficient to
account for it. Nor yet can we find an explanation
of it in the discouragement, the sense
of impending doom, by which men’s spirits
were oppressed long before the Imperial power
began visibly to wane, for this is one of the
things which, if historically true, does itself
most urgently require explanation.</p>

<p>It may be however that our wandering
politician would be too well grounded in
Malthusian economics to regard a diminution
of population as in itself an overwhelming
calamity. And if he were pressed to describe
the weak spots in the Empire of the
Antonines he would be disposed, I think, to
look for them on the ethical rather than on the
military, the economic, or the strictly political
sides of social life. He would be inclined to
say, as in effect Mr Lecky does say, that in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
institution of slavery, in the brutalities of the
gladiatorial shows, in the gratuitous distribution
of bread to the urban mobs, are to be found the
corrupting influences which first weakened and
then destroyed the vigour of the State.</p>

<p>I confess that I cannot easily accept this
analysis of the facts. As regards the gladiatorial
shows, even had they been universal
throughout the Empire, and had they flourished
more rankly as its power declined, I should still
have questioned the propriety of attributing too
far-reaching effects to such a cause. The
Romans were brutal while they were conquering
the world: its conquest enabled them
to be brutal with ostentation; but we must not
measure the ill consequences of their barbaric
tastes by the depth of our own disgusts, nor
assume the Gothic invasions to be the natural
and fitting Nemesis of so much spectacular
shedding of innocent blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>As for the public distributions of corn, one
would wish to have more evidence as to its
social effects. But even without fully accepting
the theory of the latest Roman historian, who
believes that, under the then prevailing conditions
of transport, no very large city could exist
in Antiquity, if the supply of its food were left
to private enterprise, we cannot seriously regard
this practice, strange as it seems to us, as an
important element in the problem. Granting
for the sake of argument that it demoralised
the mob of Rome, it must be remembered that
Rome was not the Empire, nor did the mob
of Rome govern the Empire, as once it had
governed the Republic.</p>

<p>Slavery is a far more important matter.
The magnitude of its effects on ancient
societies, difficult as these are to disentangle,
can hardly be exaggerated. But with what
plausibility can we find in it the cause of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
Rome’s decline, seeing that it was the concomitant
also of its rise? How can that
which in Antiquity was common to every state,
have this exceptional and malign influence upon
one? It would not in any case be easy to
accept such a theory; but surely it becomes
impossible when we bear in mind the enormous
improvement effected under the Empire both
in the law and the practice of slavery. Great
as were its evils, they were diminishing evils—less
ruinous as time went on to the character
of the master, less painful and degrading to the
slave. Who can believe that this immemorial
custom could, in its decline, destroy a civilisation,
which, in its vigour, it had helped to
create?</p>

<p>Of course our observer would see much in
the social system he was examining which he
would rightly regard as morally detestable and
politically pernicious. But the real question<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
before him would not be ‘are these things good
or bad?’ but ‘are these things getting better
or getting worse?’ And surely in most cases
he would be obliged to answer ‘getting better.’
Many things moreover would come under his
notice fitted to move his admiration in a much
less qualified manner. Few governments have
been more anxious to foster an alien and higher
culture, than was the Roman Government to
foster Greek civilisation. In so far as Rome
inherited what Alexander conquered, it carried
out the ideal which Alexander had conceived.
In few periods have the rich been readier to
spend of their private fortunes on public objects.
There never was a community in which associations
for every purpose of mutual aid
or enjoyment sprang more readily into existence.
There never was a military monarchy
less given to wars of aggression. There never
was an age in which there was a more rapid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
advance in humanitarian ideals, or a more
anxious seeking after spiritual truth. There
was much discussion, there was, apart from
politics, but little intolerance. Education was
well endowed, and its professors held in high
esteem. Physical culture was cared for. Law
was becoming scientific. Research was not
forgotten. What more could be reasonably
expected?</p>

<p>According to our ordinary methods of
analysis it is not easy to say what more <em>could</em>
be reasonably expected. But plainly much more
was required. In a few generations from the
time of which I am speaking the Empire lost
its extraordinary power of assimilating alien and
barbaric elements. It became too feeble either
to absorb or to expel them: and the immigrants
who in happier times might have bestowed
renewed vigour on the commonwealth, became,
in the hour of its decline, a weakness and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
peril. Poverty grew as population shrank.
Municipal office, once so eagerly desired, became
the most cruel of burdens. Associations
connected with industry or commerce, which
began by freely exchanging public service for
public privilege, found their members subjected
to ever increasing obligations, for the due performance
of which they and their children were
liable in person and in property. Thus while
Christianity, and the other forces that made for
mercy, were diminishing the slavery of the slave,
the needs of the Bureaucracy compelled it to
trench ever more and more upon the freedom
of the free. It was each man’s duty (so ran
the argument) to serve the commonwealth: he
could best serve the commonwealth by devoting
himself to his calling if it were one of public
necessity: this duty he should be required
under penalties to perform, and to devote if
necessary to its performance, labour to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
limits of endurance, fortune to the last shilling,
and family to the remotest generation. Through
this crude experiment in socialism, the civilised
world seemed to be rapidly moving towards a
system of universal caste, imposed by no immemorial
custom, supported by no religious
scruple, but forced on an unwilling people by
the Emperor’s edict and the executioner’s lash.</p>

<p>These things have severally and collectively
been regarded as the causes why in the West
the Imperial system so quickly crumbled into
chaos. And so no doubt they were. But they
obviously require themselves to be explained
by causes more general and more remote; and
what were these? If I answer as I feel disposed
to answer—Decadence—you will properly
ask how the unknown becomes less
unknown merely by receiving a name. I reply
that if there be indeed subtle changes in the
social tissues of old communities which make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
them, as time goes on, less resistant to the
external attacks and the internal disturbances
by which all communities are threatened, overt
recognition of the fact is a step in advance.
We have not an idea of what ‘life’ consists in,
but if on that account we were to abstain from
using the term, we should not be better but
worse equipped for dealing with the problems
of physiology; while on the other hand if we
could translate life into terms of matter and
motion to-morrow, we should still be obliged to
use the word in order to distinguish the material
movements which constitute life or exhibit it,
from those which do not. In like manner we
are ignorant of the inner character of the cell
changes which produce senescence. But should
we be better fitted to form a correct conception
of the life-history of complex organisms if we
refused to recognise any cause of death but
accident or disease? I admit, of course, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
the term ‘decadence’ is less precise than ‘old
age’: as sociology deals with organisms far
less definite than biology. I admit also that it
explains nothing. If its use is to be justified at
all, the justification must depend not on the
fact that it supplies an explanation, but on the
fact that it rules out explanations which are
obvious but inadequate. And this may be a
service of some importance. The facile generalisations
with which we so often season the
study of dry historic fact; the habits of political
discussion which induce us to catalogue for
purposes of debate the outward signs that distinguish
(as we are prone to think) the standing
from the falling state, hide the obscurer, but
more potent, forces which silently prepare the
fate of empires. National character is subtle
and elusive; not to be expressed in statistics
nor measured by the rough methods which
suffice the practical moralist or statesman. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
when through an ancient and still powerful
state there spreads a mood of deep discouragement,
when the reaction against recurring ills
grows feebler, and the ship rises less buoyantly
to each succeeding wave, when learning languishes,
enterprise slackens, and vigour ebbs
away, then, as I think, there is present some
process of social degeneration, which we must
perforce recognise, and which, pending a satisfactory
analysis, may conveniently be distinguished
by the name of ‘decadence.’</p>

<p>I am well aware that though the space I
have just devoted to the illustration of my
theme provided by Roman history is out of all
proportion to the general plan of this address,
yet the treatment of it is inadequate and perhaps
unconvincing. But those who are most reluctant
to admit that decay, as distinguished
from misfortune, may lower the general level
of civilisation, can hardly deny that in many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
cases that level may for indefinite periods shew
no tendency to rise. If decadence be unknown,
is not progress exceptional? Consider the
changing politics of the unchanging East<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. Is
it not true that there, while wars and revolutions,
dynastic and religious, have shattered ancient
states and brought new ones into being, every
community, as soon as it has risen above the
tribal and nomad condition, adopts with the rarest
exceptions a form of government which, from its
very generality in Eastern lands, we habitually
call an ‘oriental despotism’? We may crystallise
and re-crystallise a soluble salt as often
as we please, the new crystals will always
resemble the old ones. The crystals, indeed,
may be of different sizes, their component<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
molecules may occupy different positions within
the crystalline structure, but the structure itself
will be of one immutable pattern. So it is, or
seems to be, with these oriental states. They
rise, in turn, upon the ruins of their predecessors,
themselves predestined to perish by a like fate.
But whatever their origin or history, they are
always either autocracies or aggregations of
autocracies; and no differences of race, of
creed, or of language seem sufficient to vary
the violent monotony of their internal history.
In the eighteenth century theorists were content
to attribute the political servitude of the
Eastern world to the unscrupulous machinations
of tyrants and their tools. And such explanations
are good as far as they go. But this,
in truth, is not very far. Intrigue, assassination,
ruthless repression, the whole machinery
of despotism supply particular explanations of
particular incidents. They do not supply the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
general explanation of the general phenomenon.
They tell you how this ruler or that obtained
absolute power. They do not tell you why
every ruler is absolute. Nor can I furnish the
answer. The fact remains that over large and
relatively civilised portions of the world popular
government is profoundly unpopular, in the
sense that it is no natural or spontaneous social
growth. Political absolutism not political freedom
is the familiar weed of the country.
Despots change but despotism remains: and
if through alien influences, like those exercised
by Greek cities in Asia, or by British rule in
India, the type is modified, it may well be
doubted whether the modification could long
survive the moment when its sustaining cause
was withdrawn.</p>

<p>Now it would almost seem as if in lands
where this political type was normal a certain
level of culture (not of course the same in each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
case) could not permanently be overpassed. If
under the excitement of religion or conquest,
or else through causes more complicated and
more obscure, this limit has sometimes been
left behind, reaction has always followed, and
decadence set in. Many people indeed, as I
have already observed, take this as a matter
of course. It seems to them the most natural
thing in the world that the glories of the
Eastern Khalifate should decay, and that the
Moors in Morocco should lose even the memory
of the learning and the arts possessed but three
centuries ago by the Moors in Spain. To me
it seems mysterious. But whether it be easy
of comprehension or difficult, if only it be true,
does it not furnish food for disquieting reflexion?
If there are whole groups of nations
capable on their own initiative of a certain
measure of civilisation, but capable apparently
of no more, and if below them again there are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
(as I suppose) other races who seem incapable
of either creating a civilisation of their own, or
of preserving unaided a civilisation impressed
upon them from without, by what right do we
assume that no impassable limits bar the path
of Western progress? Those limits may not
yet be in sight. Surely they are not. But
does not a survey of history suggest that
somewhere in the dim future they await our
approach?</p>

<p>It may be replied that the history of Rome,
on which I dwelt a moment ago, shews that
arrested progress, and even decadence, may
be but the prelude to a new period of vigorous
growth. So that even those races or nations
which seem frozen into eternal immobility may
base upon experience their hopes of an awakening
spring.</p>

<p>I am not sure, however, that this is the
true interpretation of the facts. There is no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
spectacle indeed in all history more impressive
than the thick darkness settling down over
Western Europe, blotting out all but a faint
and distorted vision of Graeco-Roman culture,
and then, as it slowly rises, unveiling the variety
and rich promise of the modern world. But
I do not think we should make this unique
phenomenon support too weighty a load of
theory. I should not infer from it that when
some wave of civilisation has apparently spent
its force, we have a right to regard its withdrawing
sweep as but the prelude to a new
advance. I should rather conjecture that in
this particular case we should find, among other
subtle causes of decadence, some obscure disharmony
between the Imperial system and the
temperament of the West, undetected even by
those who suffered from it. That system,
though accepted with contentment and even
with pride, though in the days of its greatness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
it brought civilisation, commerce, and security
in its train, must surely have lacked some
elements which are needed to foster among
Teutons, Celts, and Iberians the qualities,
whatever these may be, on which sustained
progress depends. It was perhaps too oriental
for the occident, and it certainly became more
oriental as time went on. In the East it was,
comparatively speaking, successful. If there
was no progress, decadence was slow; and but
for what Western Europe did, and what it
failed to do, during the long struggle with
militant Mahommedanism, there might still be
an Empire in the East, largely Asiatic in population,
Christian in religion, Greek in culture,
Roman by political descent.</p>

<p>Had this been the course of events large
portions of mankind would doubtless have been
much better governed than they are. It is
not so clear that they would have been more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
‘progressive.’ Progress is with the West: with
communities of the European type. And if
<em>their</em> energy of development is some day to
be exhausted, who can believe that there remains
any external source from which it can
be renewed? Where are the untried races
competent to construct out of the ruined
fragments of our civilisation a new and better
habitation for the spirit of man? They do not
exist: and if the world is again to be buried
under a barbaric flood, it will not be like that
which fertilised, though it first destroyed, the
western provinces of Rome, but like that which
in Asia submerged for ever the last traces of
Hellenic culture.</p>

<p>We are thus brought back to the question
I put a few moments since. What grounds
are there for supposing that we can escape the
fate to which other races have had to submit?
If for periods which, measured on the historic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
scale, are of great duration, communities which
have advanced to a certain point appear able to
advance no further; if civilisations wear out,
and races become effete, why should we expect
to progress indefinitely, why for us alone is the
doom of man to be reversed?</p>

<p>To these questions I have no very satisfactory
answers to give, nor do I believe that
our knowledge of national or social psychology
is sufficient to make a satisfactory answer
possible. Some purely tentative observations
on the point may, however, furnish a fitting
conclusion to an address which has been tentative
throughout, and aims rather at suggesting
trains of thought, than at completing them.</p>

<p>I assume that the factors which combine
to make each generation what it is at the
moment of its entrance into adult life are in
the main twofold. The one produces the raw
material of society, the process of manufacture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
is effected by the other. The first is physiological
inheritance, the second is the inheritance
partly of external conditions of life, partly of
beliefs<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>, traditions, sentiments, customs, laws,
and organisation—all that constitute the social
surroundings in which men grow up to maturity.</p>

<p>I hazard no conjecture as to the share borne
respectively by these two kinds of cause in producing
their joint result. Nor are we likely to
obtain satisfactory evidence on the subject till,
in the interests of science, two communities of
different blood and different traditions consent
to exchange their children at birth by a universal
process of reciprocal adoption. But even in the
absence of so heroic an experiment, it seems safe
to say that the mobility which makes possible
either progress or decadence, resides rather
in the causes grouped under the second head
than in the physiological material on which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
education, in the widest sense of that ambiguous
term, has got to work. If, as
I suppose, acquired qualities are not inherited,
the only causes which could fundamentally
modify the physiological character of any particular
community are its intermixture with
alien races through slavery, conquest, or immigration;
or else new conditions which varied
the relative proportion in which different
sections of the population contributed to its
total numbers. If, for example, the more successful
members of the community had smaller
families than the less successful; or if medical
administration succeeded in extinguishing maladies
to which persons of a particular constitution
were specially liable; or if one strain in a
mixed race had a larger birth rate than another—in
these cases and in others like them, there
would doubtless be a change in the physiological
factor of national character. But such changes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
are not likely, I suppose, to be considerable,
except, perhaps, those due to the mixture of
races;—and that only in new countries whose
economic opportunities tempt immigrants widely
differing in culture, and in capacity for culture,
from those whose citizenship they propose to
share.</p>

<p>The flexible element in any society, that
which is susceptible of progress or decadence,
must therefore be looked for rather in the
physical and psychical conditions affecting the
life of its component units, than in their inherited
constitution. This last rather supplies a limit
to variations than an element which does itself
vary: though from this point of view its importance
is capital. I at least find it quite
impossible to believe that any attempt to provide
widely different races with an identical
environment, political, religious, educational,
what you will, can ever make them alike.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
They have been different and unequal since
history began; different and unequal they are
destined to remain through future periods of
comparable duration.</p>

<p>But though the advance of each community
is thus limited by its inherited aptitudes, I do
not suppose that those limits have ever been
reached by its unaided efforts. In the cases
where a forward movement has died away, the
pause must in part be due to arrested development
in the variable, not to a fixed resistance
in the unchanging factor of national character.
Either external conditions are unfavourable; or
the sentiments, customs and beliefs which make
society possible have hardened into shapes which
make its further self-development impossible;
or through mere weariness of spirit the community
resigns itself to a contented, or perhaps
a discontented, stagnation; or it shatters itself
in pursuit of impossible ideals, or for other and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
obscurer reasons, flags in its endeavours, and
falls short of possible achievement.</p>

<p>Now I am quite unable to offer any such
general analysis of the causes by which these
hindrances to progress are produced or removed
as would furnish a reply to my question.
But it may be worth noting that a social force
has come into being, new in magnitude if not
in kind, which must favourably modify such
hindrances as come under all but the last of the
divisions in which I have roughly arranged
them. This force is the modern alliance
between pure science and industry. That on
this we must mainly rely for the improvement
of the material conditions under which societies
live is in my opinion obvious, although no one
would conjecture it from a historic survey of
political controversy. Its direct moral effects
are less obvious; indeed there are many most
excellent people who would altogether deny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
their existence. To regard it as a force fitted
to rouse and sustain the energies of nations
would seem to them absurd: for this would
be to rank it with those other forces which have
most deeply stirred the emotions of great communities,
have urged them to the greatest
exertions, have released them most effectually
from the benumbing fetters of merely personal
preoccupations,—with religion, patriotism, and
politics. Industrial expansion under scientific
inspiration, so far from deserving praise like
this, is in their view, at best, but a new
source of material well-being, at worst the
prolific parent of physical ugliness in many
forms, machine made wares, smoky cities,
polluted rivers, and desecrated landscapes,—appropriately
associated with materialism and
greed.</p>

<p>I believe this view to be utterly misleading,
confounding accident with essence, transient accompaniments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
with inseparable characteristics.
Should we dream of thus judging the other
great social forces of which I have spoken?
Are we to ignore what religion has done for the
world because it has been the fruitful excuse for
the narrowest bigotries and the most cruel persecutions?
Are we to underrate the worth of
politics, because politics may mean no more than
the mindless clash of factions, or the barren
exchange of one set of tyrants or jobbers for
another? Is patriotism to be despised because
its manifestations have been sometimes vulgar,
sometimes selfish, sometimes brutal, sometimes
criminal? Estimates like these seem to me
worse than useless. All great social forces
are not merely capable of perversion, they are
constantly perverted. Yet were they eliminated
from our social system, were each man, acting
on the advice, which Voltaire gave but never
followed, to disinterest himself of all that goes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
on beyond the limits of his own cabbage garden,
decadence I take it, would have already far
advanced.</p>

<p>But if the proposition I am defending may
be wrongly criticised, it is still more likely to
be wrongly praised. To some it will commend
itself as a eulogy on an industrial as distinguished
from a military civilisation: as a
suggestion that in the peaceful pursuit of wealth
there is that which of itself may constitute a
valuable social tonic. This may be true, but
it is not my contention. In talking of the
alliance between industry and science my emphasis
is at least as much on the word science
as on the word industry. I am not concerned
now with the proportion of the population
devoted to productive labour, or the esteem
in which they are held. It is on the effects
which I believe are following, and are going
in yet larger measure to follow, from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
intimate relation between scientific discovery
and industrial efficiency, that I most desire
to insist.</p>

<p>Do you then, it will be asked, so highly rate
the utilitarian aspect of research as to regard it
as a source, not merely of material convenience,
but of spiritual elevation? Is it seriously to
be ranked with religion and patriotism as an
important force for raising men’s lives above
what is small, personal, and self-centred? Does
it not rather pervert pure knowledge into a
new contrivance for making money, and give a
fresh triumph to the ‘growing materialism of
the age’?</p>

<p>I do not myself believe that this age is
either less spiritual or more sordid than its
predecessors. I believe, indeed, precisely the
reverse. But however this may be, is it not
plain that if a society is to be moved by the
remote speculations of isolated thinkers it can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
only be on condition that their isolation is not
complete? Some point of contact they must
have with the world in which they live, and
if their influence is to be based on widespread
sympathy, the contact must be in a region where
there can be, if not full mutual comprehension,
at least a large measure of practical agreement
and willing co-operation. Philosophy has never
touched the mass of men except through
religion. And, though the parallel is not complete,
it is safe to say that science will never
touch them unaided by its practical applications.
Its wonders may be catalogued for purposes of
education, they may be illustrated by arresting
experiments, by numbers and magnitudes which
startle or fatigue the imagination; but they will
form no familiar portion of the intellectual furniture
of ordinary men unless they be connected,
however remotely, with the conduct of ordinary
life. Critics have made merry over the naive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
self-importance which represented man as the
centre and final cause of the universe, and
conceived the stupendous mechanism of nature
as primarily designed to satisfy his wants and
minister to his entertainment. But there is
another, and an opposite, danger into which it
is possible to fall. The material world, howsoever
it may have gained in sublimity, has,
under the touch of science, lost (so to speak) in
domestic charm. Except where it affects the
immediate needs of organic life, it may seem
so remote from the concerns of men that in the
majority it will rouse no curiosity, while of
those who are fascinated by its marvels, not a
few will be chilled by its impersonal and
indifferent immensity.</p>

<p>For this latter mood only religion or religious
philosophy can supply a cure. But for
the former, the appropriate remedy is the
perpetual stimulus which the influence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
science on the business of mankind offers to
their sluggish curiosity. And even now I
believe this influence to be underrated. If
in the last hundred years the whole material
setting of civilised life has altered, we owe it
neither to politicians nor to political institutions.
We owe it to the combined efforts of those
who have advanced science and those who
have applied it. If our outlook upon the
Universe has suffered modifications in detail so
great and so numerous that they amount collectively
to a revolution, it is to men of science
we owe it, not to theologians or philosophers.
On these indeed new and weighty responsibilities
are being cast. They have to harmonise
and to coordinate, to prevent the new from
being one-sided, to preserve the valuable essence
of what is old. But science is the great instrument
of social change, all the greater because
its object is not change but knowledge;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
and its silent appropriation of this dominant
function, amid the din of political and religious
strife, is the most vital of all the revolutions
which have marked the development of modern
civilisation.</p>

<p>It may seem fanciful to find in a single recent
aspect of this revolution an influence which
resembles religion or patriotism in its appeals
to the higher side of ordinary characters—especially
since we are accustomed to regard
the appropriation by industry of scientific discoveries
merely as a means of multiplying the
material conveniences of life. But if it be
remembered that this process brings vast sections
of every industrial community into admiring relation
with the highest intellectual achievement,
and the most disinterested search for truth;
that those who live by ministering to the
common wants of average humanity lean for
support on those who search among the deepest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
mysteries of Nature; that their dependence is
rewarded by growing success; that success
gives in its turn an incentive to individual
effort in no wise to be measured by personal
expectation of gain; that the energies thus
aroused may affect the whole character of
the community, spreading the beneficent contagion
of hope and high endeavour through
channels scarcely known, to workers<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in fields
the most remote; if all this be borne in mind it
may perhaps seem not unworthy of the place
I have assigned to it.</p>

<p>But I do not offer this speculation, whatever
be its worth, as an answer to my original
question. It is but an aid to optimism, not
a reply to pessimism. Such a reply can only
be given by a sociology which has arrived
at scientific conclusions on the life-history of
different types of society, and has risen above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
the empirical and merely interrogative point of
view which, for want of a better, I have adopted
in this address. No such sociology exists at
present, or seems likely soon to be created.
In its absence the conclusions at which I
provisionally arrive are that we cannot regard
decadence and arrested development as less
normal in human communities than progress;
though the point at which the energy of advance
is exhausted (if, and when it is reached) varies
in different races and civilisations: that the
internal causes by which progress is encouraged,
hindered, or reversed, lie to a great extent
beyond the field of ordinary political discussion,
and are not easily expressed in current
political terminology: that the influence which a
superior civilisation, whether acting by example
or imposed by force, may have in advancing
an inferior one, though often beneficent, is not
likely to be self supporting; its withdrawal will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
be followed by decadence, unless the character
of the civilisation be in harmony both with the
acquired temperament and the innate capacities
of those who have been induced to accept it:
that as regards those nations which still advance
in virtue of their own inherent energies, though
time has brought perhaps new causes of disquiet,
it has brought also new grounds of hope; and
that whatever be the perils in front of us, there
are, so far, no symptoms either of pause or of
regression in the onward movement which for
more than a thousand years has been characteristic
of Western civilisation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3">[3]</a> This remark arises out of a train of thought suggested
by two questions which are very pertinent to the subject
of the Address.</p>

<p>(1) Is a due succession of men above the average
in original capacity necessary to maintain social progress?
and</p>

<p>(2) If so, can we discover any law according to which
such men are produced?</p>

<p>I entertain no doubt myself that the answer to the first
question should be in the affirmative. Democracy is an excellent
thing; but, though quite consistent with progress, it
is not progressive <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</i>. Its value is regulative not dynamic;
and if it meant (as it never does) substantial uniformity,
instead of legal equality, we should become fossilised at once.
Movement may be controlled or checked by the many; it
is initiated and made effective by the few. If (for the
sake of illustration) we suppose mental capacity in all its
many forms to be mensurable and commensurable, and
then imagine two societies possessing the same average
capacity—but an average made up in one case of equal
units, in the other of a majority slightly below the average
and a minority much above it, few could doubt that the
second, not the first, would show the greatest aptitude for
movement. It might go wrong, but it would go.</p>

<p>The second question—how is this originality (in its
higher manifestations called genius) effectively produced?
is not so simple.</p>

<p>Excluding education in its narrowest sense—which few
would regard as having much to do with the matter—the
only alternatives seem to be the following:</p>

<p>Original capacity may be no more than one of the
ordinary variations incidental to heredity. A community
may breed a minority thus exceptionally gifted, as it breeds
a minority of men over six feet six. There may be an
average decennial output of congenital geniuses as there is
an average decennial output of congenital idiots—though
the number is likely to be smaller.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>But if this be the sole cause of the phenomenon,
why does the same race <em>apparently</em> produce many men
of genius in one generation and few in another? Why
are years of abundance so often followed by long periods
of sterility?</p>

<p>The most obvious explanation of this would seem to
be that in some periods circumstances give many openings
to genius, in some periods few. The genius is constantly
produced; but it is only occasionally recognised.</p>

<p>In this there must be some truth. A mob orator in
Turkey, a religious reformer in seventeenth century Spain,
a military leader in the Sandwich islands, would hardly get
their chance. Yet the theory of opportunity can scarcely
be reckoned a complete explanation. For it leaves unaccounted
for the <em>variety</em> of genius which has in some
countries marked epochs of vigorous national development.
Athens in the fifth and fourth centuries, Florence in the
fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, Holland in the later
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, are the typical examples.
In such periods the opportunities of statesmen, soldiers,
orators, and diplomatists, may have been specially frequent.
But whence came the poets, the sculptors, the painters,
the philosophers and the men of letters? What peculiar
opportunities had <em>they</em>?</p>

<p>The only explanation, if we reject the idea of a mere
coincidence, seems to be, that quite apart from opportunity,
the exceptional stir and fervour of national life evokes or
may evoke qualities which in ordinary times lie dormant,
unknown even to their possessors. The potential Miltons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
are ‘mute’ and ‘inglorious’ not because they cannot find
a publisher, but because they have nothing they want to
publish. They lack the kind of inspiration which, on this
view, flows from social surroundings where great things,
though of quite another kind, are being done and thought.</p>

<p>If this theory be true (and it is not without its
difficulties) one would like to know whether these undoubted
outbursts of originality in the higher and rarer
form of genius, are symptomatic of a general rise in the
number of persons exhibiting original capacity of a more
ordinary type. If so, then the conclusion would seem to
be that some kind of widespread exhilaration or excitement
is required in order to enable any community to extract
the best results from the raw material transmitted to it by
natural inheritance.</p>
